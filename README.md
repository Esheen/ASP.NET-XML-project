# ASP.NET-XML-project
Create a system that: <br>
a) Asks for some type of identifier (customer name, user ID, item number) from a DROP DOWN LIST or RADIO BUTTON (!!!) in an HTML document.<br>
b) Write an ASP.NET program that uses that HTML identifier to retrieve data from a remote database (a repeating group within a repeating group) and then generate an XML file.Â  The XML file must contain a repeating group within a repeating group. <br>
c) Validate the generated XML file with an XSD file, and format it with an XSLT transform <br>
d) Use the XSLT transform to generate a table-oriented HTML stream or file, with headings, a header, etc., sent to the end user.
